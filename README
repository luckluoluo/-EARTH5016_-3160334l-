mian0 to mian000 are respectively the 2D codes considering only heat conduction and heating, the 2D code considering groundwater and faults, and the trial codes using implicit format and second-order upwind format. However, the final running result of main000 was unsuccessful. I can't figure out the specific reason for now. The output images show extremely high temperatures, which is quite strange. Could it be that I made a mistake in writing the implicit equation?
